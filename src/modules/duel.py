  Here's a little tutorial:

  $attack: deal damage to your enemy!
  $defence: boost your defence!
  $dodge: focus on dodging attacks!
  $pet: who knows what future might bring?
  $feed: do it when you're wounded, and I'll do my best to share good vibes with you!
  $bonk: ah, the ultimate high-risk move. Use only with caution!
  $stats: displays your statistics! Does not end your turn, so you may do it whenever you want. But don't spam it, okay?
  $finish: ends the duel immidiatly.

  Okay then, if everything's clear - show me your determination!
